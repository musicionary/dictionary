# Dictionary App
 Project focusing on Ruby classes and class encapsulation, rspec testing and Capybara unit testing, Sinatra routing and user input in a site that allows a user to input a word, and the words definition.  The home page displays a list of words, and when clicked, shows their definition.  Also uses bootstrap styling and additional css styling


Make an application that contains two classes: One for Word, and one for Definition. The homepage of the app should list all words, and let you click on them to view all of their definitions. A user should be able to add a word, and when viewing a word, be able to add one or more definitions

All previous objectives are in place (see below).
Objects are created from a custom class with custom methods.
An instance of one class appears in the method of another class.
Sinatra routes process GET and POST requests/responses.
Discuss the flow of your code and the concepts behind it with an instructor using correct terminology.

Specs have complete coverage for the behaviors that need to be tested.
All specs are passing.
Logic is easy to understand.
Code has proper indentation and spacing.
Variable names are descriptive.
Sinatra application uses views, instance variables and forms.
Good Git documentation (regular commits with clear, consistently formatted messages and complete README).
Message syntax should complete the sentence "This commit will..."; for example "update image files on the home page".
README should include application name, author name, description, setup instructions, licensing.
Application is deployed to Heroku (include the link in your README)
